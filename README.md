# TensorFlow Metadata

TensorFlow Metadata provides standard representations for metadata that are
useful when training machine learning models with TensorFlow.

The metadata serialization formats include:

* A schema describing tabular data (e.g., tf.Examples).
* A collection of summary statistics over such datasets.

The metadata may be produced by hand or automatically during input data
analysis, and may be consumed for data validation, exploration, and
transformation.
